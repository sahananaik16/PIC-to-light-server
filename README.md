# PIC-to-light-server
The PIC to Light project simulates a warehouse-sales desk setup using a PIC18F4580, where inventory is managed via communication between a single master and multiple slaves. UART handles user input at the host, while CAN protocol connects the master to slaves. Each slave is identified by a unique ID, ensuring accurate data flow.
